Conversion of fuel burned on routes coded in C# WindowsForms with unit tests

The user has to enter two data indicating, in sequence from the top, the liters of fuel, or more precisely the tank of the vehicle filled to full, and the route in kilometers he intends to drive and then you will see the result of fuel burned given in liters for the route of 100km. In addition, the user can enter the price of fuel per liter and under the result of fuel burned per 100km you will see the calculated price per 100km and the price for the entire route to be driven. Everything happens via a button and also you can reset the windows from the given data with another button.
